# classic-snake-game

A simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The game runs entirely in the console, where the player navigates the snake using arrow keys, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions. A fun project to understand game logic, loops, and real-time input handling in C++.
